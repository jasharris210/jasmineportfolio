        <p>As websites worldwide continue
            to have problems with hackers and their
            malicious attacks, there is a high demand
            to improve cybersecurity.
            The Duke office of indormation<
            technology wanted to protect duke
            domains by reducing these
            attacks.</p>

        <p>Creating a bug bounty program : an
            incentive-based initiative that rewards

            platform provides students with hands-on 
            experience in cybersecurity while also 
            improving the security of Duke systems.
